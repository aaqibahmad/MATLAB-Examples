## Hello:
Human beings can extend their awareness to adapt to changing environments. For that to happen, they start "learning". While learning is a simple task for most humans, it is too difficult and complicated for machines to gain new information or skills from data. In fact, a machine's level of knowledge is directly related to its capacity to understand. Machine learning tries to overcome this difficult mission. In other terms, machine learning is the artificial intelligence division that tries to find a answer to this question: How to allow computer to to do the learning?

### MATLAB by MathWorks: 
When we claim the computer is learning, we assume the system will infer from examples of ideal actions or previous experiences and knowledge. More formal definition of machine learning by Tom Mitchell is A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. As a part of my learning process, I thought to share the knowledge and my approaches in this field with everyone.
